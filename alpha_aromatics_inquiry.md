**Subject:** Private Label Fragrance Development - Ultra-Niche Luxury Brand

**Email Body:**
```
Hello Alpha Aromatics Team,

I'm launching an ultra-niche luxury fragrance brand called Obsidian House and would like to discuss a private label fragrance development project.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Brand: Obsidian House (ultra-premium positioning)  
- Product: MANUSCRIPT 001 (signature fragrance)
- Target Market: Young luxury consumers (16-25 years)
- Initial Order: 300 bottles (with plans for larger reorders)

FRAGRANCE SPECIFICATIONS:
I'm looking for a sophisticated masculine scent with these characteristics:
- Style: Fresh-woody luxury fragrance
- Top Notes: Fresh pineapple, bergamot, blackcurrant
- Middle Notes: Birch, patchouli, jasmine  
- Base Notes: Musk, oakmoss, ambergris, vanilla
- Performance: 6-8 hour longevity, moderate to strong projection
- Similar style to high-end niche fragrances (Creed Aventus inspiration)

PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS:
- 50ml crystal clear glass bottles (premium feel)
- Custom labels: "OBSIDIAN HOUSE" + "SPECIAL RESERVE No. 1"
- Black luxury packaging boxes with magnetic closure
- Black velvet pouches and authentication cards
- Professional, ultra-premium presentation

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
1. Sample of your closest match to the scent profile described
2. Pricing breakdown for 300 units (all-inclusive with packaging)
3. Production timeline from approval to delivery
4. Minimum order quantities and payment terms
5. Regulatory compliance documentation (FDA, etc.)

BUDGET & TIMELINE:
- Budget: $6,000-10,000 for initial 300-unit run
- Timeline: Need samples ASAP, production within 4-6 weeks
- Future orders: Planning 500-1000 unit reorders quarterly

BUSINESS DETAILS:
Obsidian House is positioned as an ultra-exclusive fragrance brand with "vault access" marketing. We're targeting the luxury lifestyle market through Instagram and direct-to-consumer sales.

I'd prefer to start with a phone conversation to discuss the project in detail. Are you available for a call this week?

Looking forward to potentially working together on this exciting luxury fragrance launch.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Phone Number]
Founder, Obsidian House
[Your Email Address]

P.S. - I'm particularly interested in Alpha Aromatics because of your reputation for quality and regulatory compliance. This is a serious business launch, not a hobby project.

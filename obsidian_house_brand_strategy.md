"There's a fragrance that costs $8 to make
But sells for $500+ elsewhere üëë

We cut out the middleman
And the flashy marketing budget

Same sophisticated blend
90% less cost

But only 500 bottles exist.
And only for those who know.

Swipe up for vault access üîê"
```

**Feed Post 1:**
```
"POV: You discovered the fragrance that
billionaires' sons wear to prep school üéì

Not sold in Sephora.
Not advertised anywhere.
Only available through whispers.

MANUSCRIPT 001
The scent insiders won't shut up about.

DM "VAULT" for access üì©

#ObsidianHouse #UltraNiche #ForThoseWhoKnow"
```

**Reels Hook:**
```
"Ultra-niche fragrances that smell 
better than $500 designer bottles:

üîπ MANUSCRIPT 001 - $95
   (Smells like success & sophistication)

üîπ Limited to 500 bottles globally
üîπ No retail stores
üîπ Invite-only access

The rich stay quiet about these for a reason."

"Why we limit production to 500 bottles:

Exclusivity isn't about price.
It's about access.

When everyone wears the same designer scents,
how do you stand out?

You discover what others don't know.
You wear what others can't find.

That's the Obsidian House difference.

MANUSCRIPT 001
For the discerning few.
